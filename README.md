Description: 

Feelio is an installation, that is designed to hang on your wall. It consists of a series of small canvases
connected to servos, which move back and forth in response to body motion detected by a bracelet w/ accelerometer
worn by a person miles away from home. This setup creates a sense of physical presence in the house, even when the 
person is absent.

Hardware for Prototype v1: 

Mini Servos x4 
Motion Sensor x1
Accelerometer sensor x1
Arduino UNO x1
Mini Canvas x4
Multi Power Supply x1
Breadboard x1
